# MOS-ABC-Export-Report
This project focused on analyzing export performance using Excel exclusively. I processed 10,000+ rows of transaction data and merged it with master item information to create a clean dataset. I implemented ABC segmentation, identified top-performing products and regions, and visualized sales trends and shipping statuses. The resulting dashboard provided actionable insights into product profitability and regional export strength.

**üìò Project Background**

Global export businesses often struggle to monitor performance trends across multiple product groups, regions, and years. One such case is MOS ABC, which manages the international export of food and agricultural products. Due to the diversity of goods and global reach, it is crucial to have a clear understanding of sales performance, product profitability, and delivery effectiveness.

This project was designed to analyze export performance from 2010 to 2017, by consolidating key metrics such as total sales, net profit, sales channels, delivery status, and product segmentation into one interactive dashboard. The goal was to uncover insights that could guide strategic decision-making and expansion planning.

**üß© Project Summary**

**üîé Problem**

The company lacked a comprehensive, data-driven view of export performance across time, product categories, and global markets. This made it difficult to evaluate which products and regions were most profitable and where improvements were needed.

**üéØ Objective**
1. Analyze export sales and profit trends from 2010 to 2017
2. Identify top-performing products, groups, and regions
3. Evaluate delivery efficiency and sales channels
4. Provide data-driven recommendations for business expansion

**üõ†Ô∏è Solution**

Developed an interactive dashboard using Microsoft Excel, combining various visualizations to highlight:
1. Sales trends over 8 years
2. Top 5 products, groups, and sub-groups by units sold and net profit
3. Geographic insights by region and country
4. Delivery performance (on-time vs delayed)
5. Online vs offline sales channels
6. Summary of best-performing areas for volume and profit

**üõ†Ô∏è My Contribution**
1. Cleaned and standardized raw export data
2. Created pivot tables to aggregate and summarize key metrics
3. Designed a comprehensive dashboard covering:
    - Sales trend (2010‚Äì2017)
    - Top 5 export products, groups, and sub-groups
    - Top countries by units sold and net profit
    - Delivery performance (on-time vs delayed)
    - Sales channel analysis (online vs offline)
4. Generated executive-level insights and recommendations

**üìÇ Data Preparation & Processing**

The dataset used in this project underwent several cleaning and transformation steps to ensure accuracy and clarity of insights. The raw data was cleaned to remove inconsistencies, standardize formats, and handle missing values.

After the data cleaning process, pivot tables were created to summarize and structure key metrics such as:
1. Sales trends by year
2. Product performance by category, group, and sub-group
3. Regional and country-level breakdowns by units sold and net profit
4. Delivery status and sales channels

These pivot tables were then transformed into a comprehensive dashboard that provides visual insights into export performance from 2010 to 2017. The final output allows for easier interpretation and supports strategic business analysis.

**üìà Key Insights**
1. Total net profit: 110M+ | Total units sold: 50M+
2. Fishes sub-group ranked highest in volume and profit
3. Botswana had the highest net profit by region
4. Europe dominated both in volume and revenue
5. Delivery on time rate: 87% | Online sales share: 49%

**‚úÖ Outcome**
1. Total units sold: 50 million+; Total net profit: 110 million+
2. Fishes emerged as the top sub-group in both volume and profit
3. Botswana generated the highest net profit by region
4. Europe led in both units sold and total profit by continent
5. Strategic conclusion: Fishes sub-group should be prioritized for future expansion due to consistent top performance in units sold and profitability

**üí° Insights & Recommendations**
1. Sales Performance Trend
    - Insight: Sales peaked in 2014 at over 37M units, followed by a sharp decline in 2017 (20.4M).
    - Recommendation: Investigate potential causes behind the sales drop post-2014 and redesign marketing or distribution strategies to restore growth.

2. Top Performing Product & Sub-Group
    - Insight: The product Hippoglossus (Common Halibut) sold the most units, while the Fishes sub-group consistently led in both volume and net profit.
    - Recommendation: Allocate more investment and marketing efforts toward the Fishes category to maintain and expand its market dominance.

3. Regional Profitability
    - Insight: Botswana generated the highest net profit among all countries (1.04M), while Europe led by continent (29M).
    - Recommendation: Use Botswana as a reference for market success and consider expanding further within high-performing regions like Europe.

4. High Volume but Low Value
    - Insight: While Books are not part of this dataset, a similar pattern was seen in certain products with high unit sales but lower net profit.
    - Recommendation: Re-evaluate pricing or bundling strategies to improve margins on high-volume but low-value items.

5. Delivery Performance
    - Insight: 87% of orders were delivered on time, while 13% were delayed.
    - Recommendation: Monitor the causes of delivery delays and collaborate with logistics partners to ensure consistent on-time delivery performance.

6. Sales Channel Balance
    - Insight: Sales were nearly evenly split between online (49%) and offline (51%) channels.
    - Recommendation: Maintain both channels, but consider enhancing digital presence to leverage potential growth from online markets.
